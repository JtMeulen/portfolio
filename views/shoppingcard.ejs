	<p>ShoppingCard was the first web development project I made for myself. I had followed courses online for some time and this was my test to see how far I had gotten. I mainly wanted to make use of Databases and Authentication. This WebApp is basically a To-Do list that I use on a day-to-day basis for my grocery list.</p> 

	<p>Styling wasn't my priority for this project. I mainly focused on the functionality. I have this app connected to MongoDB. At first I had the page reload on every request. I knew it was possible to use asynchronous code, but didn't know how to use it yet. When I learned how to do that, I came back and updated this project. It now uses AJAX to make the experience smoother.</p>
	
	<p>
	For this webapp I have used the following dependencies:	
	</p>
	
	<ul class="dependencies">
		<li>NodeJs</li>
		<li>Express</li>
		<li>MongoDB</li>
		<li>Passport</li>
		<li>jQuery</li>
		<li>AJAX</li>
	</ul>

	<p>This project lives on Heroku and is connected to MongoDB.</p>
